# Wallet Communication

## How the ATM "talks"

When someone uses the LightningATM, they will insert a certain amount of coins into the ATM and expect bitcoin /satoshis back for it. 

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
