# Hardware requirements

## ðŸ›’ What you will need ...

1. **Raspberry Pi Zero WH**
2. **16 GB SD Card**
3. **PaPiRus Zero - ePaper / eInk Screen**
4. **Raspberry Pi Zero Camera \(5MP\)**
5. **Coin Acceptor 616**
6. **Button**
7. **Jumper Cables**
8. **USB Cable**
9. **Power supply \(Option 1 or 2\)**
10. **Blue tack and double-sided tape or glue**
11. **Case for the ATM**

### 1. Raspberry Pi Zero WH - [http://bit.ly/2maXBr6](http://bit.ly/2maXBr6)

If you can, get the version WH \(not just W\). It comes with pre-soldered headers and can be used out of the box. You should technically also be able to make this work on other versions of the Raspberry Pi but I haven't tried it. 

### 2. 16 GB Micro SD Card - [http://bit.ly/39anM4f](http://bit.ly/39anM4f)

8 GB Micro SD card will also work. Just pick any brand with a reasonably good rating. Make sure you've got an adapter to insert your SD card into a computer.
